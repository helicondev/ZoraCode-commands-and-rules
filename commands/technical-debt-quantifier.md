## Template
Use the following systematic approach to analyze the technical debt of the code:

{{input}}

SYSTEMATIC DEBT ANALYSIS:
1. DEBT IDENTIFICATION & CATEGORIZATION:
   - Code debt: Complex, duplicated, or poorly structured code
   - Architecture debt: Suboptimal architectural decisions
   - Test debt: Missing or inadequate test coverage
   - Documentation debt: Outdated or missing documentation
   - Infrastructure debt: Outdated tools, platforms, or dependencies

2. QUANTITATIVE IMPACT MEASUREMENT:
   - Calculate development velocity impact (story points/sprint reduction)
   - Measure bug frequency correlation with debt areas
   - Analyze customer satisfaction impact from debt-related issues
   - Calculate opportunity cost of new feature development delays

3. MAINTENANCE COST ANALYSIS:
   - Estimate time spent on workarounds per sprint
   - Calculate increased onboarding time for new developers
   - Measure additional QA time due to debt-related instability
   - Analyze production support overhead from technical debt

4. RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX:
   - Identify single points of failure due to technical debt
   - Analyze security vulnerabilities from outdated dependencies
   - Check for compliance risks from technical shortcuts
   - Verify scalability limitations from architectural debt

5. REMEDIATION ROI CALCULATION:
   - Estimate effort required for debt remediation
   - Calculate long-term development velocity improvements
   - Project reduced maintenance costs post-remediation
   - Analyze competitive advantage from improved agility

6. PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:
   - Create debt impact vs. effort matrix
   - Align debt reduction with business objectives
   - Plan incremental debt reduction strategy
   - Design metrics for debt reduction progress tracking
